CSS variables are the easiest way to customize the theme. The variables are organized into two layers:

- Global
- Component

Global variables change the layout/look-and-feel of the whole chat UI, meanwhile component variables change only a part of it (for example message component).

Component variables can be further grouped in the following ways:

- **Theme variables** for changing text and background colors, borders and shadows
- **Layout variables** defined for some components (but not all) to change the size of a specific part of a component

You can find the list of components below:
