CSS variables are the easiest way to customize the theme. The variables are organized into two layers:

- Theme
- Component

This page contains information about the theme variables.

Theme layer variables can be grouped into four different categories:

- Colors
- Fonts
- Spacing and sizing
- Border radiuses

You can read about each category in detail in the tables below.

[//]: # '#SLOT-autogenerated-theme-variables'

All theme variables are defined in: [https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-css/blob/main/src-v2/styles/\_theme-variables.scss](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-css/blob/main/src-v2/styles/_theme-variables.scss)

If you find that these variables are too high-level and you need more granular control over theming, you also have the option to provide [component layer overrides](./component-variables.mdx).
