CSS variables are the easiest way to customize the theme. The variables are organized into two layers:

- Global
- Component

Global variables change the layout/look-and-feel of the whole chat UI, meanwhile component variables change only a part of it (for example message component).

Global variables can be grouped into the following categories:

- **Theme**: colors, typography and border radiuses [//]: # '#SLOT-autogenerated-theme-variables'
- **Layout**: spacing (padding and margin) and sizing [//]: # '#SLOT-autogenerated-layout-variables'

If you find that these variables are too high-level and you need more granular control, you also have the option to provide [component layer overrides](./component-variables.mdx).
