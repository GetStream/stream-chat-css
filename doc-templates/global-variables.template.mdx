CSS variables are the easiest way to customize the theme. The variables are organized into two layers:

- Global
- Component

This page contains information about the global variables.

Global variables can be grouped into the following categories:

- Theme: colors, typography and border radiuses
- Layout: spacing (padding and margin) and sizing

You can read about each category in detail in the tables below.

## Theme variables

[//]: # '#SLOT-autogenerated-theme-variables'

## Layout variables

[//]: # '#SLOT-autogenerated-layout-variables'

If you find that these variables are too high-level and you need more granular control, you also have the option to provide [component layer overrides](./component-variables.mdx).
