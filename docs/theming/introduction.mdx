:::info
The default chat UI has a new theming and customization system. This page contains information about the new version (version 2). The most significant improvements of the new version:

- Refreshed design
- Better customization
- Support for RTL layout

The [old theme](../concepts/theming-and-css.mdx) can still be used with the latest SDK versions, but it's now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
:::

:::info
The following page contains code examples using SCSS, but our library supports CSS as well:

```css
@import "~stream-chat-angular/src/assets/styles/v2/css/index.css";
```

## Customization

Our theming system has various different customization options allowing for smaller and large-scale UI changes as well. The above list contains all the different customization options.

### CSS variables

CSS variables are the easiest way to customize the theme. The variables are organized into two layers:

- theme
- component

#### Theme variables

You can use theme layer variables to change the look and feels of the whole chat UI (as opposed to changing the design of individual components). These variables can be grouped into three categories:

- Colors
- Fonts
- Border radiuses
- Spacing (makes the chat UI more spacious/compact)

The [full list of theme variables](./theme-variables.mdx) can be found in our theme variables guide.

Here is the default chat UI:
TODO: replace with screenshot including channel as well

<img src={ChannelListScreenshot} width="500" />

Here is how you can customize theme variables:

```scss
@import "~stream-chat-angular/src/assets/styles/v2/scss/index.scss";

.str-chat {
  --str-chat__spacing-px: 1.2px;
  --str-chat__primary-color: #6c5a86;
  --str-chat__active-primary-color: #30234d;
  --str-chat__surface-color: #e9e7ed;
  --str-chat__secondary-surface-color: #e9e7ed;
}
```

Here is the result:
TODO: replace with screenshot including channel as well

<img src={ChannelListCustomizedScreenshot} width="500" />

:::note
The `str-chat` class is applied to the [channel list](../components/ChannelListComponent.mdx) and [channel](../components/ChannelComponent.mdx) component, all CSS variables are declared on this level, if you don't use those components in your chat application you'll have apply this class manually.
:::

#### Component variables

You can use component layer variables to change the design of individual components. The [full list of component variables](./component-variables.mdx) can be found in our component variables guide.

Component variables don't inherit, so for example if you set the font on the channel preview (`--str-chat__channel-preview-font-family`) the channel avatar component won't inherit that setting:

```scss
.sstr-chat {
  --str-chat__channel-preview-font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
}
```

Here is the result:

<img src={ChannelPreviewThemeScreenshot1} width="500" />

If you want the avatar component to use the same font as the channel preview component, you'll have to change the avatar's font settings as well:

```scss
.str-chat__channel-preview {
  --str-chat__avatar-font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
}
```

The above code snippet will change the font only for the avatar components that are located inside the channel preview component.

Here is the result:

<img src={ChannelPreviewThemeScreenshot2} width="500" />

### CSS overrides

If you'd like to add customizations that are not supported by CSS variables, you can override parts of the default CSS:

```scss
@import "~stream-chat-angular/src/assets/styles/v2/scss/index.scss";

// Provide your overrides after the stream-chat-angular stylesheet imports
.str-chat__channel-preview-messenger--last-message {
  font-style: italic;
}
```

If you're using SCSS it's also possible to import component stylesheets separately (instead of our bundled stylesheet):

```scss
// Use default theme for channel list and channel preview components
@import "~stream-chat-angular/src/assets/styles/v2/scss/ChannelList/ChannelList-layout.scss";
@import "~stream-chat-angular/src/assets/styles/v2/scss/ChannelList/ChannelList-theme.scss";
@import "~stream-chat-angular/src/assets/styles/v2/scss/ChannelPreview/ChannelPreview-layout.scss";
@import "~stream-chat-angular/src/assets/styles/v2/scss/ChannelPreview/ChannelPreview-theme.scss";

.str-chat__avatar {
  // Custom CSS for avatar component
}
```

### Apply your own look and feel

If you want to create a truly custom look and feel, it can be exhausting to override the default styling. In that case, it's possible only to apply layout rules from the default theme.

Here is how you can import the layout stylesheet:

```scss
@import "~stream-chat-angular/src/assets/styles/v2/scss/index.layout.scss";
```

or if you're using CSS:

```css
@import "~stream-chat-angular/src/assets/styles/v2/css/index.layout.css";
```

<img src={ChannelListLayoutScreenshot} width="500" />

The result will be a minimalistic UI without

- coloring
- fonts
- borders
- shadows

## Dark and light themes

The default theme has dark and light variants. You can switch between the two using the [`ThemeService`](../services/ThemeService.mdx).

```typescript
import { ThemeService } from 'stream-chat-angular';

constructor(themeService: ThemeService) {
  themeService.theme$.next('dark');
}
```

Here is what the dark theme looks like:
TODO: replace with screenshot containing channel as well

<img src={ChannelListDarkScreenshot} width="500" />

:::note
The `str-chat__theme-dark`/`str-chat__theme-light` class is applied to the [channel list](../components/ChannelListComponent.mdx) and [channel](../components/ChannelComponent.mdx) components, this class is responsible for switching between the dark and light theme color combinations, if you don't use those components in you chat application you'll have apply the theme classes manually.
:::

Here is how you can provide different color configurations for the dark and light themes:

```scss
@import "~stream-chat-angular/src/assets/styles/v2/scss/index.scss";

.str-chat__theme-light {
  --str-chat__primary-color: #6c5a86;
  --str-chat__active-primary-color: #30234d;
  --str-chat__surface-color: #e9e7ed;
  --str-chat__secondary-surface-color: #e9e7ed;
}

.str-chat__theme-dark {
  --str-chat__primary-color: #84759a;
  --str-chat__active-primary-color: #554173;
  --str-chat__surface-color: #30234d;
  --str-chat__secondary-surface-color: #3d2f5a;
}
```

You can add component layer overrides to light and dark themes:

```scss
@import "~stream-chat-angular/src/assets/styles/v2/scss/index.scss";

.str-chat__theme-light {
  --str-chat__primary-color: #6c5a86;
  --str-chat__active-primary-color: #30234d;
  --str-chat__surface-color: #e9e7ed;
  --str-chat__secondary-surface-color: #e9e7ed;
  --str-chat__avatar-background-color: #57634b;
}

.str-chat__theme-dark {
  --str-chat__primary-color: #84759a;
  --str-chat__active-primary-color: #554173;
  --str-chat__surface-color: #30234d;
  --str-chat__secondary-surface-color: #3d2f5a;
  --str-chat__avatar-background-color: #d2deb7;
}
```

### Creating your own theme

It's possible to extend the existing themes with your own themes.

Here is an example creating 'blue', 'pink' and 'purple' themes:

```scss
@import "~stream-chat-angular/src/assets/styles/v2/scss/index.scss";

// Make sure to use the proper naming convention: str-chat__theme-<your theme>
.str-chat__theme-blue {
  // You can use the predefined theme and component layer variables
  --str-chat__primary-color: #1976d2;
  --str-chat__avatar-background-color: #004ba0;
}

.str-chat__theme-pink {
  --str-chat__primary-color: #d81b60;
  --str-chat__avatar-background-color: #a00037;
}

.str-chat__theme-purple {
  --str-chat__primary-color: #5e35b1;
  --str-chat__avatar-background-color: #65499c;
}
```

Set the theme using the [`ThemeService`](../services/ThemeService.mdx):

```typescript
import { ThemeService } from 'stream-chat-angular';

constructor(themeService: ThemeService) {
  themeService.theme$.next('blue');
}
```

## RTL support

The layout was built with RTL support in mind. You can use the RTL layout by using the `direction` CSS attribute:

```scss
html {
  direction: rtl;
}
```

Here is the result:

<img src={ChannelListRtlScreenshot} width="500" />

## CSS logical properties and polyfills

Our CSS implementation uses [CSS logical properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Logical_Properties) for RTL support, [browser support](https://caniuse.com/?search=logical%20properties) for these properties isn't universal. Our implementation contains polyfills for logical properties. To use them, you'll have to [provide at least one `[dir]` attribute in your HTML](https://github.com/csstools/postcss-dir-pseudo-class#maintaining-specificity).
